# itsm-rbac — Bug Log / Gotchas

- **Closest ancestor wins — a grant on a parent satisfies children.** `check_permission` stops at
  the first ancestor in the chain that has an explicit `RoleModulePermission` row. So granting
  `itsm.tickets` (read=true) covers `itsm.tickets.comments` even with no row on the child. Watch
  this when you intend to *deny* a child: you must add an explicit child row that denies, because
  an inherited parent grant would otherwise allow it.
- **Cache must be invalidated on every permission write.** `check_permission` caches for 5 min.
  Any code path that edits roles/grants/assignments must call `invalidate_permission_cache()`
  (clears the whole cache). The built-in ViewSets do; new admin write paths must too, or stale
  grants linger up to 5 minutes.
- **`module_code = None` allows any authenticated user.** Intentional for utility endpoints
  (`MeView`), but don't forget to set `module_code` on real resources or you've opened them up.
- **Private comments / bulk rely on the per-action override.** Gating for those depends on the
  handler carrying its own `module_code` attribute (e.g. `@action ... ; comments.module_code =
  "itsm.tickets.comments_private"`). If the override isn't set, the view-level `itsm.tickets`
  module is used and private comments leak to anyone with ticket read.
- **Plan vs code: it's `RoleAssignment`, not a `system_role` FK on User.** Anything referencing
  `user.system_role` is wrong; use `user.itsm_role_assignment.role` / `get_user_role(user)`.
- **One role per user.** `RoleAssignment.user` is OneToOne — a second assignment for the same user
  raises an IntegrityError. Multi-role is a future expansion.
- **`role` on assignment is PROTECT.** You can't delete a `SystemRole` that still has assignments;
  reassign users first.
- **Superusers always pass** and report `role = supervisor` in `auth/me` even without an
  assignment — they bypass the resolver entirely.
